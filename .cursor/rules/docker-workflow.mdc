# Docker Development Workflow

This project uses Docker Compose for the WordPress development environment.

## Container Management
- WordPress container mounts [wordpress/](mdc:wordpress/) directory as a volume
- Changes to local files are immediately reflected in the running container
- MySQL data persists in Docker volume `mysql_data`

## Development Workflow
1. Always ensure containers are running before accessing WordPress at `http://localhost:8000`
2. Use `docker-compose logs -f wordpress` to debug issues
3. For database access, connect to `localhost:3306` with credentials: root/root
4. Container restarts preserve both WordPress files and database data

## Configuration
- [docker-compose.yml](mdc:docker-compose.yml) defines the service configuration
- [wordpress/wp-config.php](mdc:wordpress/wp-config.php) contains WordPress-specific settings
- Environment variables can be set in docker-compose.yml for configuration management
